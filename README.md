# Old-Fashioned-Snake-Game-Unity

## Development in progress

The Snake game in Unity is a classic arcade-style game where players control a growing snake to eat food and avoid collisions with its own tail or the game boundaries. The primary objective of this project is to provide a learning resource for game development enthusiasts, especially those interested in understanding the basics of game mechanics and implementing simple gameplay features.
